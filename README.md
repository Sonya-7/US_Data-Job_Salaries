# Project Description
This assessment is an in-depth analysis of the salary details for North American employers whose employees are also located in North America. <br />

### ***<ins>Demographics</ins>***
The cleaned dataset contains 4 years of salary details for Data-related careers from 2020 to 2023 and comprises 8,080 records.
- 28 collected in 2020
- 87 collected in 2021
- 1,323 collected in 2022
- 6,642 collected in 2023

The Data job categories reported include: 
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning and AI
- Data Management and Strategy
- Cloud and Database
- Data Engineering
- Data Quality and Operations
- BI and Visualization
- Leadership and Management
- Data Architecture and Modeling
- Data Science and Research

The participants reported the following experience levels:
 - Entry-Level
 - Mid-Level
 - Senior
 - Executive
 
They also reported the following work settings:
 - In-Person
 - Remote
 - Hybrid<br /><br />

### ***<ins>Salary Data</ins>***
The maximum reported salary across all categories over the 4 years is $450,000.00 for a Mid-level Research Scientist while the minimum reported salary stands at $24,000.00 for an Entry-level Data Scientist. The **median salary** is **$150,000.00**, representing 2.48% of the total reported jobs.

Salary **correlates positively** with experience level (0.21, highest reported) and inversely with work location (-0.046, lowest reported). On average, employees with more experience report higher salaries, while the location of work has a minimal effect on reported salary. **Full-time, in-person employees** are the highest paid, closely followed by full-time remote employees. "Machine Learning and AI" claims the title of the highest-paying job category for both in-person and remote data professionals, while "Data Architecture and Modeling" proves most lucrative for hybrid employees. 

Approximately 99% of the data has been obtained in the most recent period, making it the most significant for analysis. The median salary reported across experience levels for full-time employees has remained relatively stable over the last 2 years across work settings and experience levels. The sharpest spikes, both positive and negative, have been observed in Entry-Level positions, indicating that they have the most variability in pay most recently. Senior-level positions showed an overall positive median salary increase while Mid-level positions showed an overall decrease. Executive-level salary stayed neutral most recently. <br /><br />

### ***<ins>Data Source</ins>***
The salary data analyzed in this assessment originated from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data). The complete dataset contains salary trends for data-related careers on a global scale. To narrow our focus to the most pertinent information and address a data skew, it was refined to isolate records exclusively related to North American employers and employees.
