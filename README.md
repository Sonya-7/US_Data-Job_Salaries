Full-time, in-person employees are the highest paid among all surveyed, closely followed by full-time remote employees. Notably, Machine learning and AI claim the title of the highest-paying job category for both in-person and remote data professionals; while data architecture and modeling proves to be most lucrative for hybrid employees. <br /><br />
